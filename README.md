**Finally, a native AI image editing tool that actually uses your Apple Silicon properly.**

I got tired of slow cloud APIs and Docker containers that waste your expensive Apple Silicon. This runs Qwen Image Edit natively on your Mac with full MPS acceleration. Edit photos with natural language, generate images from scratch, all locally. No subscriptions, no Docker, no bullshit.

*This is what Mac AI should have been from day one.*

```bash
python qwen.py edit example.webp "make the dog look like a superhero" --steps 20
# ü§Ø
```

## üöÄ Installation

Clone, install, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsxkib/qwen-image-edit-macos.git
cd qwen-image-edit-macos
pip install -r requirements.txt
python qwen.py test
```

That's it. No Docker, no containers, no virtualization overhead. The repo includes an example image (`example.webp`) so you can try editing immediately:

```bash
python qwen.py edit example.webp "make the dog look like a superhero" --steps 20
```

Pure native Apple Silicon performance. If you have an M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac, this will absolutely fly.

## ‚ö° Performance

Running this on M3 Max with 128GB unified memory:

- **Quick mode (10 steps)**: Stylistic results, good for sketches
- **Quality mode (20+ steps)**: Fully formed, professional images  
- **Your GPU**: Automatically uses Apple Silicon MPS
- **Memory**: Works fine on 32GB+, excellent on 64GB+

## üèéÔ∏è Faster edits on Mac (optional GGUF)

If you want the fastest edit experience on Apple Silicon today, use the optional ComfyUI + GGUF path. It runs quantized Qwen-Image-Edit and supports 4/8-step Lightning-style workflows.

- One command setup:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_gguf.sh
```

- Then open http://127.0.0.1:8188 and load a Qwen-Image-Edit GGUF workflow (see docs/FAST_EDIT_GGUF.md). Start with 512√ó512, 4‚Äì8 steps, CFG ~1.0‚Äì2.0.

The standard CLI (diffusers) remains available below; GGUF is optional.

## üéØ Examples

```bash
# Edit the included example image
python qwen.py edit example.webp "make the dog look like a superhero" --steps 20

# Edit your own photos (drag & drop supported!)
python qwen.py edit IMG_4829.HEIC "oil painting style" --steps 20

# Transform into different styles
python qwen.py edit example.webp "turn into a cartoon" --steps 20

# Generate from scratch
python qwen.py generate "cyberpunk cityscape at night" --steps 20

# Custom sizes and settings
python qwen.py generate "mountain landscape" --size 1024x768 --steps 20 --seed 42
```

## üß∞ What You Need

- MacBook with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Python 3.8+ (you probably have this)
- 32GB+ RAM (64GB+ recommended for best performance)

*Technically works on Intel Macs but why would you do that to yourself?*

## ‚úÖ What You Get

‚úÖ **Text-to-image generation** - Think it, generate it  
‚úÖ **Image editing** - Upload photo, describe changes, done  
‚úÖ **Native MPS acceleration** - Uses Apple Silicon GPU properly
‚úÖ **Drag & drop** - Just drag files into terminal like a normal person  
‚úÖ **Auto preview** - Images pop open automatically on Mac  
‚úÖ **GPU acceleration** - Uses your expensive Apple Silicon  
‚úÖ **Single file** - It's literally just `qwen.py`  

## üîß The Technical Stuff

This uses Alibaba's latest [Qwen-Image](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image) models which are genuinely incredible. Runs natively on Apple Silicon with MPS acceleration for maximum performance.

First run downloads ~20GB of models (they cache locally). After that, it's instant startup.

## üõ†Ô∏è If Something Breaks

**GPU not working?**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('MPS available:', torch.backends.mps.is_available())"
```
Should say `True`. If not, your Mac is too old or something.

**Out of memory?** Close Chrome (you have 47 tabs open). Works best with 32GB+ RAM.

**First run slow?** It's downloading ~20GB of models. Go make coffee. After that it's fast.

**Images look unfinished?** Try `--steps 20` for fully formed results. 10 steps = stylistic, 20+ = professional.

## üñ•Ô∏è Commands

Simple CLI interface:

```bash
# Generate images
python qwen.py generate "your idea" [options]

# Edit existing images
python qwen.py edit image.jpg "your edit description"

# Key options:
--steps 10    # Quick stylistic results  
--steps 20    # High quality, fully formed
--steps 30    # Maximum quality
--size 1024x1024  # Custom size
--seed 42     # Reproducible
--output filename.png  # Custom output name

# Quick commands
python qwen.py test    # Test installation
python qwen.py status  # Check system info
```

*I built this because I wanted native speed on my Mac without Docker, cloud APIs, or weird configs. Pure Apple Silicon power.*
